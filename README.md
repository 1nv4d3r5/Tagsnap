##About Tagsnap

This is the official project repository for [Writing a Real Android App from Scratch][1] tutorial series. By the end of the series we write a real Android app - Tagsnap.

This app uses, among others, LocationManager, SQLiteDatabase, Map, and Camera etc. It allows a user to get his/ her current location, capture a picture of the location (could be a park, museum, historical landmark, or anything), add some details providing a description/ title, and selecting a category from a pre-populated list of categories. The user can either use a built-in camera, or use the Gallery app to take a picture. Later, the user will be able to see a list of all these geotagged snaps. Each item can be edited, or deleted from the list. It also has a Map view that displays markers for each of these geotagged snaps. The user can select any of these markers to see more information. These snaps will be persistent â€“ saving all the information in a local database.
